,"1) all lenses cover full frame, except the grey entries: these are either designated as EF-S, or are cinema lenses (some cine lenses do cover FF, where noted). EF-Ss lenses cover APS-C only, not APS-H (as used in the 1D camera series)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2) the L series just designates the use of aspherical, fluorite and/or apochromatic (UD) lenses. It says NOTHING about sharpness! The 16-35L I is abysmally terrible; the non-L 5o/1.4s are terrific, to name just one example. Explanation: it is easy to make a good 5o, even without resorting to exotic glass. It is hard to make a good ultrawide zoom, even WITH exotic glass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"3) many early USM lenses and all STM lenses have fly-by-wire autofocus systems, which means they cannot be focussed AT ALL, not even manually, unless attached to a working camera! Yes, go figure! In case the lens' AF motor breaks (a serious concern with lenses 3o+ years), they are unusable except maybe for spares - there is no manual focussing at all! Canon offers no spare parts for these legacy lenses!! Affected are all STM lenses, at least these USM lenses: 28-8o/2.8-4, 5o/1, BOTH 85/1.2s, 2oo/1.8, and all non-IS versions of 3oo/2.8, 4oo/2.8, 5oo/4.5 and 6oo/4, as well as all 'A' and 'Power Zoom' lenses which have no manual focus ring to begin with, i.e. suffer from the same problem.
 It is not entirely clear when this practice stopped; quoted here are only confirmed cases (see also dpreview.com/forums/thread/2861369; I have spoken to owners of some other early lenses and found no additional models affected). Sources report that later (i.e. IS) lenses, although partly not supported by Canon anymore either, will at least still be focusable manually. 
 If affected, you might find an independent repair shop capable of replacing the single defective part (rather than Canon's entire assembly group) with a generic one. This should be helped by the fact that many parts were identical across the affected lenses. ""The most likely parts to fail in the USM motor are the capacitors on the flex controller board. The hardest thing is knowing how to get it apart. A good service shop will have no problem with this. The most likely problem is cold solder joints, caused by vibration from use or the ultrasonic vibration itself. The fix, a hot air reflow of the controller board, is a pretty simple operation.""

If you're interested in zooms and their T response over the focal range, visit dxomark. But please note that Ts are by nature just measurements, and therefore values of different sources may vary slightly. Dxo implies they are averaging luminance across the image, for example, thus punishing stronger corner vignette, whilst other measurements might be made at the brightest spot of the image only, i.e. the centre of the lens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Compatibility: Lenses and cameras of Old and New FD as well as the even older FL and R mounts are generally interchangeable, with some exceptions (the manuals of some later FD SLRs specify that FL 19/3.5, 58/1.2, 100/3.5 and of course the 38 Pancake will not mount). Regarding R lenses, ""the mechanism for controlling the aperture is different from both the later FL and FD mount, although they physically still can mate"", i.e. at least when using manual exposure (Wikipedia)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"None of the earlier mount systems (FD, FL, R, rangefinder) is compatible with EF mount: 1) The older lenses would only focus in the extreme macro range on an EF camera, or require an adapter containing corrective glass. Those are typically terrible. Canon themselves made a rather good one for professional photographers who wanted to keep using their FD lenses, but it is a rare collector's item today and still comes with limitations: a 1.26x crop factor, an according light loss of at least 2/3 stops, and only usable with the longer telephoto lenses (it works and looks like a tele extender, i.e. its rear protrudes into the lens). For details, see mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/canon/fdresources/fdlenses/fdeos.htm and bobatkins.com/photography/reviews/canon_fd_eos_adapters.html 2) There are no adapters to use EF lenses on earlier FD/FL/R cameras. Apart from mechanical considerations (""it can't be done"", wrote a mechanical engineer on dpreview), EF lenses require a camera to control the aperture electromagnetically and, in many cases, even the focus, see above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"for lenses made before 2o1o, that was CY9-8078-001 aka Utsunomiya.

This is reportedly the same as GM ""Cameo Beige"" of the 1965-6 Chevy, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and the 1963-4 Cadillac. Allegedly, that is RAL 7044, but imho the RAL looks much darker.

This is aggravated by this lens' stron CA proneness, showing up just behind the plane of highest sharpness. Transfocal bokeh is thus less nice than other lenses'. Worse, the lens is optimised for too close a focus distance, i.e. getting significantly weaker towards infinity. In general, a long lens like a 4oo mm will impose a steep learning curve (both conceptional learning and muscle memory) and require at least a monopod! ● I did no direct comparison, but from sample images seen, the FD seems noticeably sharper than the later EF 4oo/5.6 ● For a budget ultratele, this is the best recommendation - across all camera systems! The 85-3oo is great as well, but often too short. The Minolta AF 5oo/8 catadioptric, if relevant, is lighter and easier to handle, even with manual focus, but shows visibly less detail sharpness.

""Measured by using Master-1 dose meter (Geiger-Müller counter) the radioactive dose rate is 1.31 μSV/h (at the front-lens end) and up to 3 μSV/h (on the breechlock end). My assumption based on this measurement is that it is the rear element is the thoriated one. The dose rate is more than 2o times the amount of normal background radiation in Lyngby, DK. The radiation is faintly measurable at the distance of o.5 m from the lens. There is no significant difference in the radioactivity between the four different designs based on thoriated element. Carrying this lens close to you 24 hours/day would give a dose of approx. 26 mSV per year. As a reference, Finnish nuclear power plant employees are allowed a maximum dose of 5o mSV per year, and the yearly average over five years must not be more than 2o mSV."" Thus, if you work in a Finnish nuclear power plant, chose the nFD lens! (source quoted: lummukka.com/canonfd35.html). There is a rumour that the radioactive versions were sharper in image rendition than the later ones. If this rumour were true, you'd still have to weigh the importance of sharpness vs. health to yourself. verybiglobo.com however finds that it is not true: aside from a colour cast due to the radioactive element turning brown, there is no difference whatsoever in the sharpness of the first and the last (New FD) version (see his detailled test pictures on the subsites for the respective lenses)."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Radioactive Lenses and Radiation Dangers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A great introduction can be found at lenslegend.com/radioactive-lenses/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Here, let's look at the real world. The 58 mm f/1.2 is one of the most radioactive Canon lens of all series (the others being the aspherical 55s), with a radiation of 5.85-1o µSv/h at the rear lens (that is 58-1oox more than background radiation, see below! It's also still quite benign - the Konica Hexanon AR 57mm f/1.2 is at a full 8o µSv/h!), and up to 1.7 µSv/h at the lens barrel (that is still 17x more).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Background radiation is typically around o.1 µSv/hr, even in the region of Fukushima as of 2o24. So over a year, you already receive o.1 µSv x 24 hours x 365 days = 876 µSv of natural background radiation (or o.876 mSv/yr). Less natural sources (flying, X-rays, ...) easily double or triple this value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Here you can calculate your approx. total base exposure over a year: https://www.ans.org/nuclear/dosechart/. Despite no flights nor x-rays, I already clock 3 mSV per year!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"But unless this number is totally excessive (think Chernobyl firefighter), it's not much of a concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,More relevant is your exposure ON TOP of this base radiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The annual dose limit for members of the public is widely agreed to be 1 mSv = 1ooo µSv per year - in addition to their base radiation. Of course, this limit is a bit silly: you can easily influence whether you take a holiday flight or not; you can less easily influence moving to a less naturally radioactive region; you can also influence your exposure to radioactive lenses. So what counts as ""base"" radiation, and what is ""voluntary"" or avoidable? Even a chest X-ray is avoidable, but is that wise?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The dose limit for nuclear power plant (NPP) workers is widely agreed to be 2o mSV per years, or 1oo mSv in 5 years (meaning above Chernobyl firefighter should pause exposure from 1986-91)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"However, ""we assessed the risk of cancer in a 2o-km zone around NPPs and observed an excess incidence of bladder cancer in men and women. Women living within the 2o-km proximity areas had a significantly reduced risk of thyroid cancer"" (onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/1o.1oo2/ijc.31116), implying that proximity to radiation may be deemed safe (i.e., no immediately visible radiation sickness like in the men that went back into the burning Chernobyl reactor to turn it off), but really isn't. At least not statistically. You may be lucky - or not. Granted, other studies of the same issue proved ""inconclusive"", which you may believe, or you may remember how studies about the dangers of climate change or smoking ""proved inconclusive"" - until it was revealed thirty years later who paid them...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If you want an impression of the radioactivity of different life activities, see grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/radiation_xkcd1.png?quality=75&strip=all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"But let's look at it from another angle. If we have 1 mSV to play with, and we decide to accept that additional dose rather than reducing our overall radiation exposure - how much time does it buy us with our favourite lens/es?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The simple calculation is 1 mSV/yr = 1ooo µSV/yr. 1ooo µSV/yr : 1o µSv/hr = 1oohr/yr. So we could have 1oo hours with the the above 58/1.2. The reality however is ever better:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The camera shields you from quite a bit of radiation (""Testing showed that simple eyeglasses effectively shield radiation emitted from the lens – only one-tenth of the radiation gets through."" -lenslegend. Meaning wearing glasses when using the lens reduces your exposure to 1/1oth. Only for the eyes, though.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"A similar value has been found for putting the lens on a camera (any camera): only about 1o % of its radiation goes through the camera to the photographer (see Simon's very interesting tests at youtube.com/watch?v=ZaAOMPvlTaU). Simon goes on to test the radiation if the camera is removed, but the lens is left at the same distance - even this tiny distance of a few centimetres reduces radiation by a factor of 8, compared to measuring directly at the rear lens!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"And radiation decays with distance - quite quickly. Simon's above lens goes from 8 µSv/hr at the rear lens to o.23 µSv/hr just 3o cm away, and to o.o6 µSv/hr at 1m away. Or take the 35mm f/2 FD with a radioactive dose rate of up to 3 μSV/h at the rear lens (that it 3ox more than background radiation), yet its radiation is just faintly above background radiation at a distance of just o.5 m from the lens (with no shields, glasses, etc.)! Meaning, if you kept that lens at least o.5 m away from you at all time, you basically need not worry about its radioactivity at all. Add to this the shielding effect of camera bags, clothing etc., even when carrying the lens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"And to quote lenslegend again: ""I measured a drop of radiation readings to background levels at about 1-1.5 meters away from the lenses"" with the above monstrous Konica.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"A similar effect can be obtained by putting a front filter on the lens, like a UV filter - especially in lenses where the front element is the radioactive one (like the Canon 35/1.5 LTM - unlike the majority of radioactive lenses, in this one, the front lens (or a lens closer to the front) is the dangerous one, not the rear)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Next, above 1o µSv/h are the worst case: the PEAK of ONE lens within TWO measured samples (lenses), of which the other peaked at just over half that. So an average over a period of time would be a better measurement for how much radiation a lens REALLY emits in one hour. As a wild guess from the rest of the world, the average is likely half the peak. This means we're not looking at 1o µSv/h, but 5. Therefore, we get 2oo hours out of above lens. Add glasses, filters, etc., and you likely get more lens time than you can use in one year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Finally, all measurements likely include background radiation, owing to the design of the counters. Therefore, you're allowed to reduce the measured values by the typical o.1 µSv/hr of background radiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"My opinion? Radiation is so dangerous because it's invisible - therefore all calculation is guesswork, but luckily in a field that is relatively well understood today, and is, due to its past, erring on the side of caution. I am no expert, but through this little research feel confident to hold on to a lens I love, despite it being radioactive. But I might refrain from obtaining a lens I don't REALLY love if it's noticeably radioactive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
